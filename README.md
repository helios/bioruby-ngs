# bio-ngs

Provides a framework for handling NGS data with Bioruby.

## Features & Aims
* Supports many tools for NGS: SAMtools, BWA, Bowtie, TopHat, Cufflinks
* Avoids conflicts: required tools and libraries are installed in a sandbox
* Detect pre insalled software at runtime 
* Reporting: text and graphs
* Simple API for developing your own scripts in Ruby


## Requirements
* http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ (the gem tries to install this tool by itself)
* http://www.gnuplot.info/ tested on version 4.6
* libxslt1-dev
* CASAVA 1.8.2 <http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/casava.ilmn>
* Java SE for running Trimmomatic
* pigz A parallel implementation of gzip for modern multi-processor, multi-core machines <http://zlib.net/pigz/>

## Install
### Quick Start
    gem install bio-ngs
* Gems dependencies resolved by RubyGems
* External software will be downloaded, compiled and installed in a sandbox
* No root grants required, no conflict with pre installed applications

### Install third party software (by default this feature is disabled)
    gem install bio-ngs -- --install-third-party

* Using system wide software

Pleas follow the instruction for your own distribution/operating system



## Tasks
We'll try to keep this list updated but just in case type `biongs -T` to get the most updated list.  
_We are working on these and other tasks, if you find some bugs, please open an issue on Github._

We expect to find `SampleSheet.csv` in your run directory, in case of a custom name user can pass it as last parameter `--sample_sheet=your_sample_sheet.csv`.  
To demultiplex your experiment

    ngs biongs convert:bcl:fastq:convert /bio/ngs/raw/110321_H001_0100_AD10TMACXX/ /bio/ngs/data/110321_H001_0100_AD10TMACXX_DATA --cpu=8 > 110321_H125_0100_AD10TMACXX.log 2>&1

This command will save the stdout on a log file in the current directory. You must specify the source directory and the destination. You can select the number of CPU to use for demultiplexing, 8 is the maximum value becase 8 lanes.  
Typing `biongs help convert:bcl:fastq:convert` you can have a list of sub tasks. Where `biongs convert:bcl:fastq:configure_conversion RUNDIR DATAOUTDIR` corresponds to `configureBclToFastq.pl`and `biongs convert:bcl:fastq:start_conversion` to `make` in the demultiplexed directory. 

### Filtering
When you have your mapped reads to a reference genome, you can decide to filter the output (GTF) to extract only those transcripts which have your desired requirements. You can filter for lenght, if it's multi or mono exon, the coverage, if it's a brand new transcript or an altrady annotated gene but with a new isoform or just the annotated transcripts.

    Scenario: filtering transcripts
    Having a transcripts.gtf dataset generated from CufflinksQuantification
    I want a only the new transcripts (also with an annotated gene)
    Which are multi exons
    With a lenght greater than 1340
    With minimum coverage greater than 10
    Then I want to save them in my_filtered_data.gtf
***
    biongs filter:cufflinks:transcripts your_original.gtf -m -l 1340 -c 10.0 -n -o my_filtered_data.gtf

Then in some case I need to extract only some of them or maybe parsing them from external programs. Biongs has a specific trask for this:

    Having my_filtered_data.gtf
    Generated by "filtering transcripts"
    I want to extract transcript number 10
    Then I want to save it in BED format
    Using UCSC notation
***
    biongs filter:cufflinks:tra_at_idx my_filtered_data.gtf #of_the_transcript_to_retrieve -u 

The first time tra_at_idx is used, it will take more time than usual becase it creates an internal index: a simple HASH mashalled and dumped, stored in a file with the name similar to the imput with an idx as postfix.

### Interacting with the FileSystem

Following the concept of convention over configuration BioNGS can discover types of files in your project directory. Suppose you have trimmed fastq  (`rtf`) from a project and you want to select just the forward trimmed fastq files:

    biongs smart:data Project rtf "|:Sample1:Sample2:Sample3:Sample4:Sample5" --root path_to_your_data_directory

you'll get the list of files with this this features.
To speed up the search, discovered and tagged files are dumped locally in `path_to_your_data_directory` under `conf` directory.

#### Type of files

Biongs has predefined tag system. In the future it will be more general and a custom configuration file will be accepted. In the mean time, these are the 
predefined tags

                :sample_sheet => {rules:[/SampleSheet.csv/]}
    }


Like for `:project` and `:sample` the user can also associate a `Proc` to have a more complex tagging strategy.


### Converting data to RDF

After quantification with Cufflinks data can be converted into RDF and this is a simple example of it
    `biongs convert:cuff:quant_to_ttl transcripts.gtf --output=transcripts.ttl --sample=SQ_0080 --project=Naive_T0 --run=110908_H125_0119_AB01W2ABXX`

in case the user do not want to specify sample, project, run and the path of the file reflects this structure:
    `110908_H125_0119_AB01W2ABXX_DATA/Project_Naive_T0/Sample_SQ_0080`

the software can extract those information automatically, just selecting the option `--get_info_from_path`

## Wrapper
Bio-Ngs comes with a build-in wrapper to map binary software directly in BioRuby as objects. From this wrapper object is possible to create Thor task as well, with a lot of sugar.
### Wrapping a binary

We want wrap TopHat the famous tool for NGS analyses.
1. The first step is to include the Wrapping module
2. set the name of the binary to call. Note: if you avid to set the program name it would not be possible to create a thor task and/or run the program
3. add the options that the binary accepts, usually if preferred to declare all the options, discover them typing `your_program_name -h`

    module Bio
      module Ngs    
        class Tophat
          include Bio::Command::Wrapper
          
          set_program Bio::Ngs::Utils.binary("tophat/tophat")
          add_option "output-dir",:type => :string, :aliases => '-o'
          add_option "min-anchor", :type => :numeric, :aliases => '-a'
          add_option "splice-mismatches", :type => :numeric, :aliases => '-m'
          #all other options that you want to expose with the wrapping
        end #Tophat
      end #Ngs
    end #Bio

is possible to use specify in the class  
    use_aliases
if you want to give a priority to short notation or if your program has only the short notation but you want to extend the task with the long one as well.
We defined a new property for add_option called `:collapse => true` is used only with `use_aliases` and it collapse the passed parameter to the short notation. An example coming from _fastx.rb_ wrapper, _note last row_:

    module Bio
      module Ngs    
        module Fastx
          class Trim
            include Bio::Command::Wrapper
            set_program Bio::Ngs::Utils.binary("fastq_quality_trimmer")
            use_aliases
            add_option :min_size, :type=>:numeric, :default=>20, :aliases => "-l", :desc=>"Minimum length - sequences shorter than this (after trimming)
            will be discarded. Default = 0 = no minimum length."
            add_option :min_quality, :type=>:numeric, :default=>10, :aliases => "-t", :desc=>"Quality threshold - nucleotides with lower 
            quality will be trimmed (from the end of the sequence)."
            add_option :output, :type=>:string, :aliases => "-o", :desc => "FASTQ output file.", :collapse=>true
            add_option :input, :type=>:string, :aliases => "-i", :desc => "FASTQ input file.", :collapse=>true
            add_option :gzip, :type => :boolean, :aliases => "-z", :desc => "Compress output with GZIP."
            add_option :verbose, :type => :boolean, :aliases => "-v", :desc => "[-v]         = Verbose - report number of sequences.
            If [-o] is specified,  report will be printed to STDOUT.
            If [-o] is not specified (and output goes to STDOUT),
            report will be printed to STDERR."
            add_option :quality_type,  :type=>:numeric, :default => 33, :aliases => "-Q", :desc=>"Quality of fastq file"
          end
        end
      end
    end

fastq_quality_trimmer accepts only short notation options and we need to pass an input file, but for some reason popen used internally doesn't work properly with the standard behavior so using `:collapse=>true` the application will be called:

    fastq_quality_trimmer -t 20 -t 10 -Q 33 -iinput_file_name.fastq -ooutput_file_name.fastq_trim

running the program by hand form the command line using a space as separator after `-i` and  `-o` works as expected. `:collapse` is a work around for this problem.



In case you program work like git which has a main program and the `sub_programs` for each feature you can use specify the sub program name with

    set_sub_program "sub_name"

The wrapper will run the command composing:

    set_program set_sub_program options arguments

A practical example of this behavior is samtools which has multiple sub programs view, merge, sort, ....
SamTools is a particular case because in biongs we are using bio-samtools a binding with FFI and the wrapper because the merge function was too complicated for the binding or at least we do not spent enough time on it, so we make the wrapping for this functionality.

This step is very similar to define a Thor task, add_option is grabbed/inspired from Thor.
Then you can user this binary also from a bioruby script just calling:

    tophat = Bio::Ngs::Tophat.new
    tophat.params = {"mate-inner-dist"=>dist, "output-dir"=>outputdir, "num-threads"=>1, "solexa1.3-quals"=>true}

__very important__: _you can pass parameters that have a name which has been previously declared in the Tophat's class. if you want to pass not declared parameters/options please use arguments._  

    tophat.run :arguments=>[index, "#{fastqs}" ]

### Define the Task
With our new wrapper, let's define a Thor task on the fly 

    class MyTasks < Thor
      desc "tophat DIST INDEX OUTPUTDIR FASTQS", "run tophat as from command line, default 6 processors"
      Bio::Ngs::Tophat.new.thor_task(self, :tophat) do |wrapper, task, dist, index, outputdir, fastqs|
        wrapper.params = {"mate-inner-dist"=>dist, "output-dir"=>outputdir, "num-threads"=>1, "solexa1.3-quals"=>true}
        wrapper.run :arguments=>[index, "#{fastqs}" ], :separator=>"="
        #you tasks here
      end
    end

Now is you list the tasks with `thor -T` you will see the new task.

You can create a new wrapper and configure it and run it from inside a Thor's tasks, like in `biongs quality:boxplot`

    desc "boxplot FASTQ_QUALITY_STATS", "plot reads quality as boxplot"
    method_option :title, :type=>:string, :aliases =>"-t", :desc  => "Title (usually the solexa file name) - will be plotted on the graph."
    method_option :output, :type=>:string, :aliases =>"-o", :desc => "Output file name. default is input file_name with .txt."
    def boxplot(fastq_quality_stats)
      output_file = options.output || "#{fastq_quality_stats}.png"
      boxplot = Bio::Ngs::Fastx::ReadsBoxPlot.new
      boxplot.params={input:fastq_quality_stats, output:output_file}
      boxplot.run
    end

### Override the run command when the binary dosen't behave normally
    module Bio
      module Ngs    
        module Samtools
          class View
            include Bio::Command::Wrapper
            set_program Bio::Ngs::Utils.binary("samtools")
            add_option "output", :type => :string, :aliases => '-o'

            alias :original_run :run
            def run(opts = {:options=>{}, :arguments=>[], :output_file=>nil, :separator=>"="})
              opts[:arguments].insert(0,"view")
              opts[:arguments].insert(1,"-b")
              opts[:arguments].insert(2,"-o")
              original_run(opts)
            end
          end #View
        end #Samtools
      end #Ngs
    end #Bio

#### Disable binary check at load time
When a wrapping is defined BioNGS verify that the program is installed on the local system, if it is not it  thrown an warning message and the task is disabled by default. This check is made for each binary wrapped, so it could takes long the first time you load BioNGS.
To skip this check the user can define an environment variable assigning one of these terms "true yes ok 1" to BIONGS_SKIP_CHECK_BINARIES

    export BIONGS_SKIP_CHECK_BINARIES=true

you can also add this setting to the .bashrc or .profile in the user home directory.

#### Warning messages
Prior to version 0.7.0 was not possible to skip warning messages and biongs was a bit slow in staring. From 0.7.0 warnin messages are disable by default. To reenable warning messages is enough
    
    export BIONGS_VERBOS=true

this setting to the .bashrc or .profile in the user home directory.

## Features
### Iterators for output files

Example CuffDiff.  In this class is possible to define an iterator for a specific set of output files: genes, isoforms, tss_groups, cds.
To activate the iterator is just a matter of call a class method in the class definition

    class Bio::Ngs::Cufflinks::Diff
      #... all the previous definitions
      #define iterators
      add_iterator_for :genes
      add_iterator_for :isoforms
      add_iterator_for :cds
      add_iterator_for :tss_groups
    end
  
This is an example of CuffDiff, parsing `genes.fpkm_tracking` file:

    Bio::Ngs::Cufflinks::Diff.foreach_gene_tracked("path_to_cuffdiff_output_directory") do |gene_fpkm_track|
      expression_profile = (1..7).map do |sample_idx|
        gene_fpkm_track["q#{sample_idx}_FPKM"].to_f
      end
      
      #do your stuff accessing this tabular file with gene_fpkm_track["name of the field"]
    end

In this case internally CSV library has been used to parse in an easy way the file, there is a lack of performances with huge files, gaining in flexibility.

## Loading or Not tasks from outside
If in your external library or binary you define LoadBaseTasks in Bio::Ngs (as a costant) requiring `'bio-ngs'` bio-ngs's tasks will not load but only the libraries.

    module Bio
      module Ngs
        LoadBaseTasks = true
      end
    end

This is something useful if you want to develop a separate binary which uses bio-ngs libraries.
Is not yet possible to define a list of desired tasks to load.
